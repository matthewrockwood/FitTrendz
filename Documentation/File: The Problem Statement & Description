# Project Name: FitTrendz (Group 2)

## Problem Statement
FitTrendz is developing an innovative e-commerce platform to help online shoppers overcome the challenges of finding stylish, well-fitting clothing while ensuring a seamless and personalized shopping experience. Many consumers struggle with selecting the right size, discovering clothing that matches their style preferences, and navigating overwhelming product catalogs. Our platform leverages outfit suggestions, a personalized size quiz, and an advanced filtering system to enhance user experience, reduce returns, and improve customer satisfaction.

## Problem Description
Online shopping for clothing presents several challenges for consumers, including difficulty in selecting the right size, finding personalized recommendations, and navigating a vast selection of products efficiently. These issues lead to frequent returns, customer dissatisfaction, and an overall frustrating shopping experience. Traditional online stores often lack features that address these concerns, relying solely on generic size charts and limited filtering options.

The stakeholders most affected by this issue include online shoppers who struggle with size and style selection, as well as e-commerce businesses facing high return rates and low customer retention. The root cause of the problem lies in the absence of personalized shopping assistance, inefficient filtering mechanisms, and inadequate customer engagement tools. Addressing these concerns with recommendations, a user-friendly interface, and improved shopping features can enhance the overall online retail experience.
