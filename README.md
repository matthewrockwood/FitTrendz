## Project Overview
FitTrendz is a modern e-commerce clothing platform built to make online shopping easier, more personalized, and more enjoyable. Many online shoppers face common challenges like figuring out the right size, finding clothes that match their personal style, or navigating through endless product listings that lack helpful sorting tools. These problems often lead to frustration, abandoned shopping carts, and high return rates. FitTrendz was created to address these issues by offering a more guided and customized shopping experience. Features like a personalized size and style quiz, an interactive outfit builder, and advanced product filters help users find what theyâ€™re looking for quickly and confidently.

The platform was developed using a full stack of modern technologies, including React for the user interface, Node.js and Express for the backend server, SQLite for lightweight and effective database management, and Stripe for secure, flexible checkout and payment processing. FitTrendz supports essential e-commerce features such as account creation, wishlists, shopping carts, promo codes, password reset, and a personalized product recommendation system. The design is mobile-friendly, clean, and easy to use, making it accessible across all devices. Whether users are shopping casually or building a complete outfit, FitTrendz delivers a smooth, enjoyable, and tailored shopping experience from start to finish.
